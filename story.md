Once upon a time in a dense jungle there lived a rabbit and a tortoise.By seeing the slow speed of the tortoise the rabbit said "you are very slow". The tortoise was very angry and said rabbit to race for the next day. The rabbit agreed. The next day, both were ready for the race. The badger said "on your marks get set go". Then both started running and rabbit was miles away from the tortoise so he decided to rest beneath a tree.
