Once upon a time in a dense jungle there lived a rabbit and a tortoise.By seeing the slow speed of the tortoise the rabbit said "you are very slow". The tortoise was very angry and said rabbit to race for the next day. The rabbit agreed. The next day, both were ready for the race. The badger said "on your marks get set go". Then both started running and rabbit was miles away from the tortoise so he decided to rest beneath a tree. The time kept on passing and the rabbit was still resting and the tortoise was ahead for rabbit and won the race. The rabbit woke up he couldn't see the tortoise he thought he is still way behind but when the rabbit reached the finish he saw that the tortoise has won the race.

So the moral of the story is we should never be lazy and we should complete when given.
